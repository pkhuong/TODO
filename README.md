TODO
====

Public TODO list. Cross between .finger braindump, all SBCL-related for now.

Priorities:

1. Source-transformed TYPEP
2. abarch's regalloc
3. Short patches, in order


Handle source-transformed TYPEP during flow-sensitive constraint
=======

Status: working branch, "just" have to review and commit.

Prioritised because it causes recent regressions.

Code review for abarch's regalloc branch
=======

It's blocking her work toward a merge.

Short patches to review/triage
=======

Doug's type VOP patches
=======

At least, apply the ones that work as is. Then see what can be improved once we select between branchful and
flagful VOPs.

Reply to posts

Doug's assembler peephole patch
=======

Thoughts so far: doubt that performing flow analysis on assembly code is a good idea. How far can we go by only matching
suffixes of some VOP followed by a sequence of VOPs? That way we can exploit TN-level dataflow information that is correct
at a VOP granularity.

Also fixes
* <=/>= direct VOPs to avoid double comisd
* multiple-value cmov

Choose between flagful and branchful :predicate VOPs more smartly
======

If both are applicable with same cost, probably want to go for label-ful VOPs if the branch doesn't "look" like a cmov.
Otherwise, it's hard to optimise for both conditional branches and conditional moves.

IR2opt
======

jump-jump tensioning could use some love. IR1 block ordering doesn't always suffice, esp. with our funky insertion of
branches during IR2. Another reason IR1 block ordering isn't enough: some blocks compile to nothing.

SB-GMP
======

Add code to check for overflowed allocation, https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/1206191

PPC threading patches
======
* Barriers in lock-free caches (e.g. memoised specifier-type)

* seqlock (frlock) in sb-concurrency get some barrier/read ordering wrong.

Not too hard SMOP

* "Re: [Sbcl-devel] full-eval bug in handling of LET* (and LAMBDA) bindings", Douglas & Christophe
* Allocate TLS indices at load-time
     - subclass global-var for specials
     - add slot to annotate with either load-time handle (see l-t-v), or index
     - pass immediate or constant SC to VOPs (bind, read, set).
* data-vector-set-with-offset: return value ourself
* disassemble: emit preambule/prologue via :keyword argument
* no-consing declaration

Jump tables
=====
expose this as a function: (defun switch (n &rest thunks) (funcall (elt thunks n))).

Norec SpecTM
========

Sequence lock only protects commit/validate. EDSL for trivial read sequence id. Writes only during commit.
